# AI-Driven-Multi-Depth-Soil-Moisture-Prediction-for-Precision-Agriculture
Predicting multi-depth soil moisture using AI to reduce sensor deployment in precision agriculture. Trained 350+ models (RF, XGBoost, LSTM) on orchard data (2023â€“2025). Random Forest performed best, showing sensors at 10 cm &amp; 50 cm provide optimal coverage.
